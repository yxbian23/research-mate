*Try an idea, measure it, keep what works, discard what doesn't, repeat forever.*

Inspired by [karpathy/autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch). Works for any optimization target: test speed, bundle size, LLM training, build times, Lighthouse scores.

## What's included

| | |
|---|---|
| **Extension** | Tools + live widget + `/autoresearch` dashboard |
| **Skill** | Gathers what to optimize, writes session files, starts the loop |

### Extension tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `init_experiment` | One-time session config — name, metric, unit, direction |
| `run_experiment` | Runs any command, times wall-clock duration, captures output |
| `log_experiment` | Records result, auto-commits, updates widget and dashboard |

### `/autoresearch` command

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `/autoresearch <text>` | Enter autoresearch mode. If `autoresearch.md` exists, resumes the loop with `<text>` as context. Otherwise, sets up a new session. |
| `/autoresearch off` | Leave autoresearch mode. Stops auto-resume and clears runtime state but keeps `autoresearch.jsonl` intact. |
| `/autoresearch clear` | Delete `autoresearch.jsonl`, reset all state, and turn autoresearch mode off. Use this for a clean start. |

**Examples:**

```
/autoresearch optimize unit test runtime, monitor correctness
/autoresearch model training, run 5 minutes of train.py and note the loss ratio as optimization target
/autoresearch off
/autoresearch clear
```

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Ctrl+X` | Toggle dashboard expand/collapse (inline widget ↔ full results table above the editor) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+X` | Open fullscreen scrollable dashboard overlay. Navigate with `↑`/`↓`/`j`/`k`, `PageUp`/`PageDown`/`u`/`d`, `g`/`G` for top/bottom, `Escape` or `q` to close. |

### UI

- **Status widget** — always visible above the editor: `🔬 autoresearch 12 runs 8 kept │ best: 42.3s`
- **Expanded dashboard** — `Ctrl+X` expands the widget into a full results table with columns for commit, metric, status, and description.
- **Fullscreen overlay** — `Ctrl+Shift+X` opens a scrollable full-terminal dashboard. Shows a live spinner with elapsed time for running experiments.
### Skill

`autoresearch-create` asks a few questions (or infers from context) about your goal, command, metric, and files in scope — then writes two files and starts the loop immediately:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `autoresearch.md` | Session document — objective, metrics, files in scope, what's been tried. A fresh agent can resume from this alone. |
| `autoresearch.sh` | Benchmark script — pre-checks, runs the workload, outputs `METRIC name=number` lines. |
| `autoresearch.checks.sh` | *(optional)* Backpressure checks — tests, types, lint. Runs after each passing benchmark. Failures block `keep`. |

## Install

```bash
pi install https://github.com/davebcn87/pi-autoresearch
```

<details>
<summary>Manual install</summary>

```bash
cp -r extensions/pi-autoresearch ~/.pi/agent/extensions/
cp -r skills/autoresearch-create ~/.pi/agent/skills/
```

Then `/reload` in pi.

## Usage

### 1. Start autoresearch

```
/skill:autoresearch-create
```

The agent asks about your goal, command, metric, and files in scope — or infers them from context. It then creates a branch, writes `autoresearch.md` and `autoresearch.sh`, runs the baseline, and starts looping immediately.

### 2. The loop

The agent runs autonomously: edit → commit → `run_experiment` → `log_experiment` → keep or revert → repeat. It never stops unless interrupted.

Every result is appended to `autoresearch.jsonl` in your project — one line per run. This means:

- **Survives restarts** — the agent can resume a session by reading the file
- **Survives context resets** — `autoresearch.md` captures what's been tried so a fresh agent has full context
- **Human readable** — open it anytime to see the full history
- **Branch-aware** — each branch has its own session

### 3. Monitor progress

- **Widget** — always visible above the editor
- **`/autoresearch`** — full dashboard with results table and best run
- **`Escape`** — interrupt anytime and ask for a summary

## Example domains

| Domain | Metric | Command |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Test speed | seconds ↓ | `pnpm test` |
| Bundle size | KB ↓ | `pnpm build && du -sb dist` |
| LLM training | val_bpb ↓ | `uv run train.py` |
| Build speed | seconds ↓ | `pnpm build` |
| Lighthouse | perf score ↑ | `lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --output=json` |

## How it works

The **extension** is domain-agnostic infrastructure. The **skill** encodes domain knowledge. This separation means one extension serves unlimited domains.

```
┌──────────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────────────┐
│  Extension (global)  │     │  Skill (per-domain)       │
│                      │     │                           │
│  run_experiment      │◄────│  command: pnpm test       │
│  log_experiment      │     │  metric: seconds (lower)  │
│  widget + dashboard  │     │  scope: vitest configs    │
│                      │     │  ideas: pool, parallel…   │
└──────────────────────┘     └──────────────────────────┘
```

Two files keep the session alive across restarts and context resets:

```
autoresearch.jsonl   — append-only log of every run (metric, status, commit, description)
autoresearch.md      — living document: objective, what's been tried, dead ends, key wins
```

A fresh agent with no memory can read these two files and continue exactly where the previous session left off.

## Configuration (optional)

Create `autoresearch.config.json` in your pi session directory to customize behavior:

```json
{
  "workingDir": "/path/to/project",
  "maxIterations": 50
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `workingDir` | string | Override the directory for all autoresearch operations — file I/O, command execution, and git. Supports absolute or relative paths (resolved against the pi session cwd). The config file itself always stays in the session cwd. Fails if the directory doesn't exist. |
| `maxIterations` | number | Maximum experiments before auto-stopping. The agent is told to stop and won't run more experiments until a new segment is initialized. |

---

## Backpressure checks (optional)

Create `autoresearch.checks.sh` to run correctness checks (tests, types, lint) after every passing benchmark. This ensures optimizations don't break things.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
pnpm test --run
pnpm typecheck
```

**How it works:**

- If the file doesn't exist, everything behaves exactly as before — no changes to the loop.
- If it exists, it runs automatically after every benchmark that exits 0.
- Checks execution time does **not** affect the primary metric.
- If checks fail, the experiment is logged as `checks_failed` (same behavior as a crash — no commit, revert changes).
- The `checks_failed` status is shown separately in the dashboard so you can distinguish correctness failures from benchmark crashes.
- Checks have a separate timeout (default 300s, configurable via `checks_timeout_seconds` in `run_experiment`).
